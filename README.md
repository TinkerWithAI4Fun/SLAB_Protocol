SLAB™ 1.0 – Standardized Labeling and Attribution Benchmark

A Trading Card Data Standard Powered by AI

[Visit SLAB Protocol SLAB(tm)bsite](https://slabprotocol.streamlit.app)

SLAB™ is an open data standard designed to bring structure and consistency to the trading card industry. It leverages AI-powered data extraction to transform unstructured card descriptions into machine-readable data.

Why SLAB™?

The trading card market lacks a universal data standard.

Descriptions vary across platforms, making it hard to search, verify, price, and manage cards.

SLAB™ introduces a standardized format to simplify inventory management, marketplace listings, and data sharing.

SLAB™ AI Builder

Our front-end app helps users:

Upload raw card data (e.g., descriptions).

Automatically extract structured fields (Year, Player, Set, Parallel, etc.) using AI.

Review, refine, and export SLAB™-compliant data (including XML).

Contribute validated data to improve the AI models.

Hybrid AI Model: Why ChatGPT + Custom Model?

After extensive testing of different approaches, we found that combining ChatGPT's natural language understanding with a custom-trained extraction model is the most effective solution for parsing trading card descriptions. Here's why:

Flexibility: ChatGPT excels at interpreting new and varied descriptions, handling edge cases better than rigid rule-based systems.

Domain-Specific Precision: Our custom model is trained specifically on trading card data, allowing it to accurately identify structured fields like Player Name, Set, and Parallel.

Iterative Improvement: The hybrid approach allows us to leverage GPT's reasoning capabilities when the custom model encounters uncertainty, improving overall accuracy.

Scalability: This approach scales well as we continuously expand the dataset and refine the model with community contributions.

Other methods we explored (regex-only parsing, rule-based systems, and standalone machine learning models) were either too brittle, required exhaustive updates, or lacked the adaptability needed to handle the rapidly evolving trading card market.

Combining GPT's language understanding with our specialized extraction model delivers the best balance of accuracy, adaptability, and scalability.

Version 1.0 Notes

This is an early test version built with Streamlit; some quirks are expected.

Focused on establishing the foundation for standardization, continually improving the model and learning AI along the way!
