# SLAB™ 1.0 – Standardized Labeling and Attribution Benchmark

## A Trading Card Data Standard Powered by AI

[Visit SLAB Protocol Website](https://slabprotocol.streamlit.app)

SLAB™ is an open data standard designed to bring structure and consistency to the trading card industry. It leverages AI-powered data extraction to transform unstructured card descriptions into machine-readable data.

## Why SLAB™?
- The trading card market lacks a universal data standard.
- Descriptions vary across platforms, making it hard to search, verify, price, and manage cards.
- SLAB™ introduces a standardized format to simplify inventory management, marketplace listings, and data sharing.

## SLAB™ AI Builder
Our front-end app helps users:
- Upload raw card data (e.g., descriptions).
- Automatically extract structured fields (Year, Player, Set, Parallel, etc.) using AI.
- Review, refine, and export SLAB™-compliant data (including XML).
- Contribute validated data to improve the AI models.

## Version 1.0 Notes
- This is an early test version built with Streamlit; some quirks are expected.
- Focused on establishing the foundation for standardization, continually improving the model and learning AI along the way!
